Populate this directory with LDGMs downloaded from our Zenodo repository by running:

```
make download
```

This downloads LDGM precision matrices, SNP lists and summary statistics, which are what is needed to run the MATLAB tutorials; these will be sufficient for most users. To download the entire repo, which is ~30GB, run:

```
make download_all
